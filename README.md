This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in Tcl: using the '==' operator to compare numbers that are stored as strings.  The '==' operator performs string comparison, which can lead to incorrect results. The bug.tcl file contains the buggy code, while bugSolution.tcl provides a corrected version.  The solution uses the 'expr' command for numerical comparison, ensuring accurate results.
